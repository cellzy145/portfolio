          <h2>1. Update Your Graphics Driver</h2>
          <p>Updating your graphics driver is one of the easiest ways to boost your PC performance, especially in newer games. Driver updates from GPU manufacturers like AMD, Intel, and Nvidia include driver level optimizations and support for new games, as well as bug fixes and possibly new features for your GPU.
          </p>

          <h3>What to Do Before Updating Your Graphics Driver</h3>
          <p>Before updating your drivers, it's important to disable Windows from automatically updating your GPU drivers. This prevents potential conflicts caused by unwanted updates or Windows replacing your custom drivers with generic ones. You can find a guide on how to disable this behavior <a href="#">here</a>.</p>

          <p>It is also important to delete the current driver before installing a later version to prevent any instability from driver conflicts. <a href="https://www.guru3d.com/download/display-driver-uninstaller-download/">Display Driver Uninstaller</a> is a great tool along with AMD’s <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/faqs/GPU-601.html">AMD Cleanup Utility</a> to remove your current graphics driver while in Safe Mode.</p>

          <h3>Where to Safely Download GPU Drivers?</h3>
          <p>GPU drivers are critical pieces of software that act as a bridge between your operating system and your graphics card. They control how your GPU renders graphics, processes workloads, and interacts with your monitor and other hardware.</p>

          <p>Because drivers operate at a low level, they have deep access to your system. A faulty or malicious driver can cause crashes, hardware instability, performance degradation — or worse, create security vulnerabilities that expose your system to malware or remote attacks.</p>

          <p>You could get safe drivers from downloading from official sources. These sources are:

          <h2>2. Use a High Performance Power Plan</h2>
            <p>Switching to a <strong>High Performance</strong> power plan can help ensure that your CPU and GPU deliver maximum performance without being held back by aggressive power-saving features. This is especially noticeable in CPUs that dynamically adjust their clock speeds based on workload.</p>

            <p>By default, Windows often uses the <strong>Balanced</strong> plan, which prioritizes energy efficiency. While that’s fine for most users, gamers and power users may benefit from setting their PC to High Performance or even <strong>Ultimate Performance</strong> (on supported systems) to reduce latency and avoid clock speed fluctuations.</p>

            <h3>How Does a High Performance Power Plan Help?</h3>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>Reduces CPU latency</strong>: Keeps the CPU clock speed higher for faster responsiveness.  </li>
              <li><strong>Prevents downclocking</strong>: The CPU doesn’t idle as often, reducing performance dips in fast-paced games.  </li>
              <li><strong>Helps older systems</strong>: If your CPU is older or inconsistent in performance, this can help smooth things out.</li>
              </ul>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em>Note: For modern desktop systems with good cooling, the increase in power usage is usually negligible while gaming. However, on laptops, it can significantly impact battery life and heat output.</em></p>
              </blockquote>

            <h3>How to Enable High Performance Power Plan</h3>
              <p><strong>Windows 10/11</strong></p>
              <ol>
                <li>Press <code>Windows + R</code>, type <code>powercfg.cpl</code>, and press Enter.  </li>
                <li>In the Control Panel window, select <strong>High Performance</strong>.
                  <ul>
                    <li>If it’s missing, click “Show additional plans.” </li>
                  </ul> 
                </li>
                <li>To enable <strong>Ultimate Performance</strong> (for enthusiast desktops):
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Open Command Prompt as Administrator.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Run: <code>powercfg -duplicatescheme e9a42b02-d5df-448d-aa00-03f14749eb61</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Go back to the Power Options window, and select <strong>Ultimate Performance</strong>.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ol>

            <h3>Why High Performance Plans Are Not Recommended for Ryzen X3D CPU Users</h3>
              <p>If you’re using any AMD Ryzen X3D processor, such as the 5800X3D, 7800X3D, or 9800X3D, avoid switching to High Performance or Ultimate Performance plans.</p>
              <p>These CPUs are designed to work best with <strong>AMD’s Balanced Power Plan</strong>, which:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Enables proper core parking, focusing workload on the right cores.  </li>
              <li>Helps with thermal management for the 3D V-Cache layer.  </li>
              <li>Ensures Windows schedules game threads on the correct CCD (for multi-CCD CPUs like 7950X3D).  </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Using any other plan may hurt game scheduling efficiency and thermals on these CPUs.</p>
              <p><em>Recommended: Install the <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/support">AMD Chipset Drivers</a> to unlock the AMD-optimized Balanced plan for your system.</em></p>

          <h2>3. Disable Unnecessary Startup Programs</h2>
            <p>Disabling unnecessary startup programs is a simple way to make your PC boot faster and perform better during games. Many background apps launch automatically when your system starts — using up RAM, CPU power, and even affecting your frame rates without you realizing it.</p>

          <h3>Benefits of Disabling Unnecessary Startup Apps</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Faster Boot Times</strong>: This is the most immediately noticeable benefit. By preventing unnecessary applications from launching at startup, Windows – as well as other operating systems – has fewer processes to initiate, thereby leading to a significantly faster boot time.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Improved System Responsiveness</strong>: With fewer apps running in the background, your system can dedicate more resources to gaming or whatever you’re actively working on.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Reduced Resource Consumption</strong>: Many startup apps – like updaters, sync clients, or launchers – use memory and CPU in the background, which can impact game performance.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Less Disk Activity</strong>: Some apps perform background indexing, syncing, or checks. Disabling them can reduce disk I/O, helping games load faster and reduce stutters.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Potentially Improved Battery Life (Laptops)</strong>: Fewer background tasks mean your laptop isn’t burning power on things you’re not using.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Less Cluttered System Tray</strong>: Trimming startup apps also reduces visual clutter, giving you a cleaner, distraction-free taskbar.
              </li>
            </ul>

          <h3>How to Disable Startup Apps in Windows</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Open Task Manager</strong><br>Press <code>Ctrl + Shift + Esc</code> or right-click the taskbar and choose <strong>Task Manager</strong>.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Go to the Startup Tab</strong><br>This shows all apps set to run at startup, along with their impact settings.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Disable Unneeded Apps</strong><br>Right-click and hit <strong>Disable</strong> on apps you don’t need immediately.</p>
                <p>Common examples:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Game launchers (Epic, EA, Battle.net – unless you use them every boot)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Cloud services like OneDrive or DropBox (if not needed instantly)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Updaters (Java, Adobe, Logitech, etc.)
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>

          <h2>6. Fix Game Stuttering by Disabling MPO (MultiPlane Overlay)</h2>
            <p>Multiplane Overlay (MPO) is a Windows feature meant to improve performance and reduce power consumption by allowing parts of the screen to be composited separately. However, in practice, it’s been linked to severe frame drops, flickering, and inconsistent frame pacing — especially on systems using G-Sync or FreeSync.</p>

            <h3>Why Disabling MPO Can Help</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Fixes microstuttering in certain games (especially borderless fullscreen).</li>
              <li>Resolves screen flickering issues in some multi-monitor or VR setups.</li>
              <li>Improves frame pacing for smoother motion in fast-paced games.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you’ve tried everything else and still experience occasional stutters — even on capable hardware — MPO might be the hidden culprit.</p>

            <h3>How to Disable MPO in Windows</h3>
            <blockquote>
            <p>⚠️ <strong>Caution</strong>: This requires a quick registry tweak. Back up your registry before proceeding.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <ol>
              <li>Press <code>Windows + R</code>, type <code>regedit</code>, and hit Enter.  </li>
              <li>Navigate to:<br><code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Dwm</code>  </li>
              <li>Right-click in the right panel → <strong>New → DWORD (32-bit) Value</strong>  </li>
              <li>Name it: <code>OverlayTestMode</code>  </li>
              <li>Set the value to: <code>5</code>  </li>
              <li>Restart your PC.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This disables MPO system-wide.</p>

            <h3>How to Re-enable MPO (if needed)</h3>
            <p>Simply delete the <code>OverlayTestMode</code> entry or set its value to <code>0</code>, then restart.</p>

            <h3>Additional Notes</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>This tweak is reversible and safe if done correctly.  </li>
              <li>Especially helpful for NVIDIA and AMD GPU users running games in borderless fullscreen.  </li>
              <li>Doesn’t significantly impact battery life or performance for most modern systems.</li>

          <h2>7. Optimize In-Game Settings for Smooth Performance</h2>
            <p>No matter how powerful your PC is, optimizing in-game settings can dramatically improve your performance and responsiveness — especially in newer, more demanding titles. It’s also the most direct way to tailor visuals and frame rates to your preferences and hardware.</p>

            <h3>Why Tweaking In-Game Settings Matters</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Boosts FPS by offloading GPU-intensive effects.</li>
                <li>Reduces input lag and improves responsiveness.</li>
                <li>Improves consistency — smoother frame pacing means fewer stutters.</li>
                <li>Adapts to your hardware — you don’t need to max everything out.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Even high-end rigs benefit from tuning settings per game, especially when aiming for high refresh rates like 120Hz or 144Hz.</p>

                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Ray Tracing</td>

                <tr>
                  <td>V-Sync</td>
                  <td>Varies</td>
                  <td>Use G-Sync/FreeSync or a frame limiter instead</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>Some settings have a <em>much larger</em> impact on performance than others.<br><em>Focus on reducing GPU-heavy effects first. Lowering just 2–3 of these can result in significant performance gains.</em></p>

            <h3>Frame Rate Targets (FPS Benchmarks)</h3>
              <p>If your game includes a built-in benchmark, use it to test setting changes before jumping in.</p>

            <h3>Pro Tip: Use Presets, Then Fine-Tune</h3>
              <p>Most games offer Low–Ultra presets. Start with the one closest to your goal FPS, then tweak individual settings for better balance. For example:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Begin with &quot;High&quot; preset</li>
                <li>Lower Shadows and Ambient Occlusion</li>
                <li>Turn off Motion Blur and V-Sync</li>
              </ul>

            <h3>Optional: Use Tools Like NVIDIA/AMD Game Optimizers</h3>
              <p><strong>GeForce Experience (NVIDIA)</strong> and <strong>AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition</strong> both offer automatic tuning based on your system specs. These can be helpful starting points, especially if you’re unsure where to begin.</p>
